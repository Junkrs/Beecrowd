Hello, I will be posting most of exercises I made in the [<em><ins>Beecrowd Online Judge</ins></em>](https://judge.beecrowd.com/en). Most of them are made in C, but I will try to add more languages as I find some free time to do so.

If you want to, you can check my [<em><ins>profile</ins></em>](https://judge.beecrowd.com/en/profile/562304) there.
